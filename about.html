                            Tracy has called the Capital Region home over 25 years. After a successful career in credit unions, Tracy returned to school to earn her Masters in Social Work from SUNY Albany. She worked for 10 years in community mental health at ClearView Center where she worked with a dedicated team to develop a highly-regarded family treatment program, vocational services, outpatient treatment program, and she coordinated the development and marketing efforts for the agency. Tracy dedicated 8 years to the American Cancer Society overseeing patient programs across 13 counties, managed the merger between Gilda’s Club of the Capital Region and ACS, and oversaw the operations of ACS’ HopeClub. She is very happy to be at St. Paul’s Center alongside dedicated and compassionate staff and volunteers as they work hard to assist homeless moms and their children. Tracy lives in East Greenbush, and shares her home with therapy dog, Samantha Jones, and too many animals to count.

                            Ruff! I’m Samantha Jones, a therapy dog with a very important job at the Center – I keep the kids occupied so the mothers can take care of business. I sit on the couch with the children as they watch TV, I roll over on the floor so they can scratch my belly, or they come to visit me while I sit in the chair in my mom’s (Tracy) office. Some of the moms in shelter like to sit with me too. Another reason why I like coming to work: so I don’t have to be home with those darn kitties!

Helping the homeless and those in need have been on my heart a great deal and led me to seek out ways to get involved. I have created “Blessing Bags” that I keep in my car for people in need I see while traveling. St. Paul’s Center and the work it does has re-appeared a number of times in my various personal and professional circles…it became clear that the Center was the right opportunity for me to make a difference. I have been blessed in countless ways and feel that my talents are being called to serve my community alongside the people of St. Paul’s Center.”
